        "React is a popular JavaScript library that helps you build user interfaces for websites and apps. When starting a new project with React, you may wonder if you should use a framework or not. React just released its new documentation React Docs and the creators of React recommend using a framework, and in this article, we'll see why.",
      description2:
        "Frameworks are pre-built sets of tools and features that can help you build websites and apps faster and more efficiently. They provide features like routing (helping you move between different parts of your site or app), data fetching (helping you get data from a server), and generating HTML (helping your site or app load faster).",
      description3:
        "While you can use React without a framework, building a project fully with React can lead to problems as your project grows. As you add more features, your JavaScript code can become larger, leading to slower load times. You may also need to figure out how to split code for every route individually or encounter server-client network waterfalls that make your app feel very slow. This is why Svelte has SvelteKit, Vue has Nuxt, and other frameworks exist to solve these problems.",
      description4:
        "React frameworks solve these problems by default, with no extra work from your side. They let you start with a lean codebase and scale your app with your needs. Each React framework has a community, so finding answers to questions and upgrading tooling is easier. Frameworks also give structure to your code, helping you and others retain context and skills between different projects.",
